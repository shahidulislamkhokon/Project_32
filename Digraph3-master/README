This Python3 software resources implement decision aid algorithms useful in the field of 
Algorithmic Decision Theory and more specifically 
in outranking based Multiple Criteria Decision Aid (MCDA).

Installation instructions:

On a (Unix, Mac OSX) command line using a git client and either, cloning from github.com:

...$ git clone https://github.com/rbisdorff/Digraph3

or, from sourceforge.net:

...$ git clone https://git.code.sf.net/p/digraph3/code Digraph3

You may as well check out a working copy using a subversion client:

...$ svn co https://leopold-loewenheim.uni.lu/svn/repos/Digraph3

You may also download and extract a zip archive fom the github link above, or a 
 zip archive (not always the latest) from 

https://sourceforge.net/projects/digraph3/.

cd to the downloaded (and extracted) Digraph3 working directory:

$Home/.../Digraph3$ make install

installs (with sudo !!) the Digraph3 modules in the current running python environment. A Pythhon 3.5+ environment is recommemded.

A 'make installVenv' allows to install instead into a private virtual python environment. Check and adapt if necessary the makefile install commands. 

If the cython C-compiled modules for Big Data are required, the Cython package must previously be installed in the running Python environment (...$ pip3.5+ install cython).

.. /Digraph3$ make tests

runs a nose test suite in the ./test directory ( python3 nose package required  ...$ pip3.5+ install nose )

.. /Digraph3$ make verboseTests
runs a verbose (with stdout not captured) nose test suite 

Tutorials and technical documentation of modules, classes and methods are available under the following link:
